# Rosewood Engine
## Context
  Personal project for learning purposes. The foundations of the engine are based on the [Game Enigne tutorial serie by TheCherno](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).
  
  The example project simply allows to load models from .OBJ files and edit materials and transforms parameters. 

## Dependencies
  Require VulkanSDK present on disk and referenced in environment variables as VULKAN_SDK.  
  Also require OpenGL32.lib.   
  Everything else is included and built with the project.

## How to build
  Only Windows supported for now.
  
  To generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution execute _generate-vs2022.bat_. Then build using Visual Studio.

## Features to come
  - Profiler
  - Compute shader
